# Project Details

Write an app that gets the current weather in the visitor's location and displays it in the DOM.

You can use [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/) to get the user's location by IP address, and [the Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current) to get weather for a location.

## Considerations

- What happens if either of the API calls fail?
- Should you display an icon or other visual element to complement the weather?
- What if a user wants the temperature in Farenheit instead of Celcius (or the other way around)?

## Need help?
